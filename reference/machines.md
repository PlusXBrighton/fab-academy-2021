## Blackboard Becomes Tidy Pen Plotter

https://hackaday.com/2021/01/03/blackboard-becomes-tidy-pen-plotter/

Printers are all well and good, but theyâ€™re generally limited to smaller paper sizes and use expensive ink. If you instead want to produce art on a larger scale, a plotter can be a great way to go. [tuenhidiy] built a tidy example using an old blackboard as a base.

These days, such a build is quite easily approachable, thanks to the broad DIY CNC and 3D printing communities. The plotter consists of a pair of stepper motors, driven by an off-the-shelf RAMPS 1.4 controller and an Arduino Mega 2560. The motors are mounted at the top corners of the blackboard, and move the pen holder via a pair of toothed belts, counter-weighted for stability. The pen holder itself mounts a simple permanent marker, and uses a servo to push the holder away from the paper for retraction, rather than moving the pen itself. Control of the system is via the Makelangelo firmware, an open-source effort capable of driving a wide variety of CNC motion systems.

This is the encyclopedic blog post I wish I could have read when I started designing my CNC router

I'll cover all the components and some of the design considerations you'll need to keep in mind when desiging your own CNC router.

This is a documentation about how to make a simple Core XY Pen Plotter. As a sample to study about Core XY (and what you need to do in MTM assignments), you can use it.
